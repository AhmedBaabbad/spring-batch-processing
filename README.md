# spring-batch-processing

Overview
Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive batch processing framework designed to enable the development of robust batch applications vital for the enterprise. It facilitates the efficient processing of large volumes of data, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data migration, report generation, and more.

This repository contains a Spring Batch Processing application that serves as a starting point for building batch processing jobs for customer entity. The application is structured with essential configurations and sample batch jobs to help you quickly grasp the basics and customize it for your specific use case.

Prerequisites
To run the Spring Batch Processing application, you'll need the following:

Java 8 (or higher)
Maven 3 (or higher)
Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AhmedBaabbad/spring-batch-processing.git
cd spring-batch-processing

Update the database configuration:

Open src/main/resources/application.properties and modify the database connection details accordingly.

Build the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the batch job:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The sample batch job will read data from the source (e.g., CSV, database), process it, and write it to the destination (e.g., database, file).

Customizing Batch Jobs

You can customize the batch jobs according to your specific requirements. Here's a general outline of how to add your batch jobs:

Create a new Spring @Configuration class and define your batch job.

Configure the reader, processor, and writer beans for your job.

Customize the job parameters, listeners, and error handling, as needed.
